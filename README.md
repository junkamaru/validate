# validate is a small project which validates Romanian social security numbers, and displays the information sotred within the number.

For example for the input 2440124398474 the outcome will be {"sex":"F","year":1944,"month":1,"day":24,"county":"Vrancea"}

On the second section of the page I have several inputs (sex, year, month...) which will output a random generated security number. If one or more input fields are\
empty the output will create a social securty number from scratch.
